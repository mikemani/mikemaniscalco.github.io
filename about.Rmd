## Research Interests

I am a PhD candidate studying Marine Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Working with <a href="https://msi.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/mark-brzezinski">Mark Brzezinski</a> and <a href="https://marine.rutgers.edu/team/kim-thamatrakoln/">Kimberlee Thamatrakoln</a> to relate community biogeochemistry and phytoplankon physiology to 'Omics measurements primarily along the California coast. I am broadly interested in ways that new and publicly available microbial Omic data can be used to answer big questions about evolution, ecology, and biogeochemistry.

Microbial Ecology | `Bioinformatics` | Molecular Biology  <br />
Data Science | `R` | 'Omics <br />
Marine Science | `Biological Oceanography` |  Biogeochemistry
